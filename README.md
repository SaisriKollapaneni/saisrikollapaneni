# 🌄 Hey there, I’m Saisri 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where code meets creativity.

## ✨ About Me

I'm a developer by day, artist by soul. When I'm not building things with code, you can usually find me:

- 📚 Lost in a twisty thriller plot, solving the mystery before the detective does
- 🏞️ Chasing sunrises on mountaintops and soaking in golden sunsets
- ✏️ Sketching stories into faces — I have a deep love for portrait drawing

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

- Polishing my full stack skills (React, Node.js, GraphQL, TypeScript)
- Creating beautiful, performant experiences — both on-screen and off
- Learning more about AI/ML and how to make machines just a little more human

## 🌟 Fun Fact

I believe a good thriller and a good bug hunt have something in common — both get your heart racing and keep you up past midnight 😄

## 📫 Let's Connect

Whether you're into code, art, or chasing sunrises — I'm always up for a good conversation.
